# Noas website README

To run the website, double click the "index.html" file.

The form validation (in Javascript) checks that the phone number is in the correct form, otherwise it alerts: "Invalid Phone Number!".
also, the name, email and message fields are required. in the html.

I used Javascript for the QUIZ page, it is a small quiz about me and when you press 'submit' you get your score and which questions were correct.
also, I used Javascript to make a smooth jump to the different sections in the page.

I wrote my entire website by myself from scratch, some of the sections are taken from examples in the internet but I made massive changes in all of them.
