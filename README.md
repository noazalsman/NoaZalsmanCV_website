# Noa Zalsman CV websites' README

To run the website, double click the "index.html" file.

Form Validation:
1. In javascript - checks if the phone number is in the correct form, otherwise alerts: "Invalid Phone Number!".
2. In the html - The name, email and message fields are required.

More JavaScript:
1. The quiz page, is a few questions about me, when you press submit, you get your score and which questions were correct. (the background of the div depends on the score).
2. If you make your screen narrow, the nav bar becomes a nice hamburger menu.
3. I used Javascript to make a smooth jump to the different sections in the page using the nav bar.

I wrote my entire website by myself from scratch, some of the sections' CSS is taken from examples in the internet but I made massive changes in all of them.
